### Graph's shortest paths

* __Dijkstra's algorithm__ is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.

* __Bellmanâ€“Ford__ algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted __digraph__. It is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm for the same problem, but more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs in which some of the edge weights are __negative numbers__.
