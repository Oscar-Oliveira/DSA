_**Dijkstra's algorithm** is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph._

_**Bellmanâ€“Ford** algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted **digraph**. It is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm for the same problem, but more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs in which some of the edge weights are **negative numbers**._
