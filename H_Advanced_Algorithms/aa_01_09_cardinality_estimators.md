### Cardinality estimators

(...) an algorithm for the count-distinct problem, __approximating the number of distinct elements in a multiset__. Calculating the exact cardinality (..) is impractical for very large data sets. Probabilistic cardinality estimators, such as the HyperLogLog algorithm, use significantly less memory than this, at the cost of obtaining only an approximation of the cardinality.
