### Bloom Filter

![](./_Assets/images/649px-Bloom_filter.svg.png)

<div class="smaller">An example of a Bloom filter, representing the set {x, y, z}. The colored arrows show the positions in the bit array that each set element is mapped to. The element w is not in the set {x, y, z}, because it hashes to one bit-array position containing 0. For this figure, m = 18 and k = 3.</div>
